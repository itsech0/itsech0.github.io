      <description>This post is mainly about the Angel Gabriel, and the confusion that the revelations cause in interpreting the Abrahamic faiths: Gabriel first appears to John the Baptist&amp;rsquo;s father, Zacharias, preparing Zacharias for the arrival of John, from the womb of Mary&amp;rsquo;s cousin Elisabeth
10 And the whole multitude of the people were praying without at the time of incense. 11 And there appeared unto him an angel of the Lord standing on the right side of the altar of incense.</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;This post is mainly about the Angel Gabriel, and the confusion that the revelations cause in interpreting the Abrahamic faiths:
Gabriel first appears to John the Baptist&amp;rsquo;s father, Zacharias, preparing Zacharias for the arrival of John, from the womb of Mary&amp;rsquo;s cousin Elisabeth&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10 And the whole multitude of the people were praying without at the time of incense.
11 And there appeared unto him an angel of the Lord standing on the right side of the altar of incense.
12 And when Zacharias saw him, he was troubled, and fear fell upon him.
13 But the angel said unto him, Fear not, Zacharias: for thy prayer is heard; and thy wife Elisabeth shall bear thee a son, and thou shalt call his name John.
14 And thou shalt have joy and gladness; and many shall rejoice at his birth.
15 For he shall be great in the sight of the Lord, and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink; and he shall be filled with the Holy Ghost, even from his mother&amp;rsquo;s womb.
16 And many of the children of Israel shall he turn to the Lord their God.
17 And he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elias, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just; to make ready a people prepared for the Lord.
18 And Zacharias said unto the angel, Whereby shall I know this? for I am an old man, and my wife well stricken in years.
19 And the angel answering said unto him, I am Gabriel, that stand in the presence of God; and am sent to speak unto thee, and to shew thee these glad tidings.
20 And, behold, thou shalt be dumb, and not able to speak, until the day that these things shall be performed, because thou believest not my words, which shall be fulfilled in their season.
— Luke 1:10-20&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the angel Gabriel appears to Mary, preparing the way for Jesus, leading to the revelation of the New Testament:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;26 And in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of Galilee, named Nazareth,
27 To a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin&amp;rsquo;s name was Mary.
28 And the angel came in unto her, and said, Hail, thou that art highly favoured, the Lord is with thee: blessed art thou among women.
29 And when she saw him, she was troubled at his saying, and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should be.
30 And the angel said unto her, Fear not, Mary: for thou hast found favour with God.
31 And, behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt call his name JESUS.
32 He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest: and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David:
33 And he shall reign over the house of Jacob for ever; and of his kingdom there shall be no end.
34 Then said Mary unto the angel, How shall this be, seeing I know not a man?
35 And the angel answered and said unto her, The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee: therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God.
36 And, behold, thy cousin Elisabeth, she hath also conceived a son in her old age: and this is the sixth month with her, who was called barren.
37 For with God nothing shall be impossible.
38 And Mary said, Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me according to thy word. And the angel departed from her.
— Luke 1:26-38&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muhammad appears to have felt the presence of this same angel, because this is the angel which provides the Quran to Muhammad, in the Cave of Hira, in a mountain near mecca. Muhammad, specifically mentions Gabriel in the Quran:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Whoever is an enemy of Allah, His angels, His messengers, Gabriel, and Michael, then ˹let them know that˺ Allah is certainly the enemy of the disbelievers.&amp;rdquo;
— Quran 2:97&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, we have a problem, if we are to take all these revelations as truth, because of this verse, in the New Testament, that says to the followers of the Bible that they should be wary if an angel intends to preach another gospel:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;But should we, or an angel from Heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached to you, let him be accursed.&amp;rdquo;
— Galatians 1:8&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first response from Muslims is that the bible was corrupted, and changed. That the gospel that Jesus preached was revealed in the past, but it has been changed. So it leaves alot of confusion. If God is not a God of confusion, what are we to do?&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>The four arts, or the four arts of the Chinese scholar, were the four main academic and artistic talents required of the aristocratic ancient Chinese scholar-gentlemen. They were the mastery of the qin (the guqin, a stringed instrument), qi (the strategy game of Go), shu (Chinese calligraphy), and hua (Chinese painting), and are also referred to by listing all four, 琴棋書畫; qínqíshūhuà. — &amp;ldquo;Four Arts&amp;rdquo;, wikipedia</description>

      <title>Noble Eight-Fold Path</title>

      <description>These are the eight noble truths in Buddhism:
Right View: our actions have consequences, death is not the end, and our actions and beliefs have consequences after death. The Buddha followed and taught a successful path out of this world and the other world (heaven and underworld/hell). Later on, right view came to explicitly include karma and rebirth, and the importance of the Four Noble Truths, when &amp;ldquo;insight&amp;rdquo; became central to Buddhist soteriology, especially in Theravada Buddhism.</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;These are the eight noble truths in Buddhism:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right View: our actions have consequences, death is not the end, and our actions and beliefs have consequences after death. The Buddha followed and taught a successful path out of this world and the other world (heaven and underworld/hell). Later on, right view came to explicitly include karma and rebirth, and the importance of the Four Noble Truths, when &amp;ldquo;insight&amp;rdquo; became central to Buddhist soteriology, especially in Theravada Buddhism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right Resolve or Intention: the giving up of home and adopting the life of a religious mendicant in order to follow the path; this concept aims at peaceful renunciation, into an environment of non-sensuality, non-ill-will (to loving kindness), away from cruelty (to compassion). Such an environment aids contemplation of impermanence , suffering, and non-Self.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right Speech: no lying, no rude speech, no telling one person what another says about him to cause discord or harm their relationship, no idle chatter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right Conduct or Action: no killing or injuring, no taking what is not given, no sexual misconduct, no material desires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right Livelihood: no trading in weapons, living beings, meat, liquor, and poisons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right Effort: preventing the arising of unwholesome states, and generating wholesome states, the bojjhagā ( Seven Factors of Awakening). This includes indriya-samvara ,&amp;ldquo;guarding the sense-doors&amp;rdquo;, restraint of the sense faculties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right Mindfulness (sati ; Satipatthana ; Sampajañña): a quality that guards or watches over the mind; the stronger it becomes, the weaker unwholesome states of mind become, weakening their power &amp;ldquo;to take over and dominate thought, word and deed.&amp;rdquo; In the vipassana movement , sati is interpreted as &amp;ldquo;bare attention&amp;rdquo;: never be absent minded, being conscious of what one is doing; this encourages the awareness of the impermanence of body, feeling and mind, as well as to experience the five aggregates (skandhas), the five hindrances, the four True Realities and seven factors of awakening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right samadhi ( passaddhi ; ekaggata ; sampasadana): practicing four stages of dhyāna (&amp;ldquo;meditation&amp;rdquo;), which includes samadhi proper in the second stage, and reinforces the development of the bojjhagā, culminating into upekkha (equanimity) and mindfulness. In the Theravada tradition and the vipassana movement, this is interpreted as ekaggata, concentration or one-pointedness of the mind, and supplemented with vipassana meditation, which aims at insight.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Four Noble Truths</title>

      <description>The Four Noble Truths describe the reality of the struggle with life and a way to curb strife through the curbing of craving and the following of the noble eight-fold path.
The Four Noble Truths are:
dukkha (literally &amp;ldquo;suffering&amp;rdquo;; here &amp;ldquo;unsatisfactoriness&amp;rdquo;) is an innate characteristic of existence in the realm of samsara;
samudaya (origin, arising, combination;&amp;lsquo;cause&amp;rsquo;): dukkha arises or continues with tanhā (&amp;ldquo;craving, desire or attachment, lit.&amp;ldquo;thirst&amp;rdquo;). tanhā is traditionally interpreted in western languages as the &amp;lsquo;cause&amp;rsquo; of dukkha , tanha can also be seen as the factor tying us to dukkha, or as a response to dukkha, trying to escape it;</description>

&lt;p&gt;nirodha (cessation, ending, confinement): dukkha can be ended or contained by the renouncement or letting go of this tanhā; the confinement of taṇhā releases the excessive bind of dukkha;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;marga (path, Noble Eightfold Path) is the path leading to the confinement of tanha and dukkha.&lt;/p&gt;
