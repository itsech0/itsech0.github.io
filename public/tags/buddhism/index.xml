      <description>These are the eight noble truths in Buddhism:
Right View: our actions have consequences, death is not the end, and our actions and beliefs have consequences after death. The Buddha followed and taught a successful path out of this world and the other world (heaven and underworld/hell). Later on, right view came to explicitly include karma and rebirth, and the importance of the Four Noble Truths, when &amp;ldquo;insight&amp;rdquo; became central to Buddhist soteriology, especially in Theravada Buddhism.</description>

      <description>The Four Noble Truths describe the reality of the struggle with life and a way to curb strife through the curbing of craving and the following of the noble eight-fold path.
The Four Noble Truths are:
dukkha (literally &amp;ldquo;suffering&amp;rdquo;; here &amp;ldquo;unsatisfactoriness&amp;rdquo;) is an innate characteristic of existence in the realm of samsara;
samudaya (origin, arising, combination;&amp;lsquo;cause&amp;rsquo;): dukkha arises or continues with tanhā (&amp;ldquo;craving, desire or attachment, lit.&amp;ldquo;thirst&amp;rdquo;). tanhā is traditionally interpreted in western languages as the &amp;lsquo;cause&amp;rsquo; of dukkha , tanha can also be seen as the factor tying us to dukkha, or as a response to dukkha, trying to escape it;</description>
