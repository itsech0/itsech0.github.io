      <description>I have getting more and more interested in trying different types of Chinese teas. I bought some in the flavors of Black Tea, Oolong, and Jasmine. They are loose and you just take 3 grams and boil them. I was able to buy some at a Chinese grocery store for a reasonable price. You can use them more than once to get more value out of them.
At first I was drinking them with sugar, but I have decided to start drinking them without sugar because its decent without sugar.</description>

      <description>This post is mainly about the Angel Gabriel, and the confusion that the revelations cause in interpreting the Abrahamic faiths: Gabriel first appears to John the Baptist&amp;rsquo;s father, Zacharias, preparing Zacharias for the arrival of John, from the womb of Mary&amp;rsquo;s cousin Elisabeth
10 And the whole multitude of the people were praying without at the time of incense. 11 And there appeared unto him an angel of the Lord standing on the right side of the altar of incense.</description>

      <description>The four arts, or the four arts of the Chinese scholar, were the four main academic and artistic talents required of the aristocratic ancient Chinese scholar-gentlemen. They were the mastery of the qin (the guqin, a stringed instrument), qi (the strategy game of Go), shu (Chinese calligraphy), and hua (Chinese painting), and are also referred to by listing all four, 琴棋書畫; qínqíshūhuà. — &amp;ldquo;Four Arts&amp;rdquo;, wikipedia</description>

      <description>These are the eight noble truths in Buddhism:
Right View: our actions have consequences, death is not the end, and our actions and beliefs have consequences after death. The Buddha followed and taught a successful path out of this world and the other world (heaven and underworld/hell). Later on, right view came to explicitly include karma and rebirth, and the importance of the Four Noble Truths, when &amp;ldquo;insight&amp;rdquo; became central to Buddhist soteriology, especially in Theravada Buddhism.</description>

      <description>The Four Noble Truths describe the reality of the struggle with life and a way to curb strife through the curbing of craving and the following of the noble eight-fold path.
The Four Noble Truths are:
dukkha (literally &amp;ldquo;suffering&amp;rdquo;; here &amp;ldquo;unsatisfactoriness&amp;rdquo;) is an innate characteristic of existence in the realm of samsara;
samudaya (origin, arising, combination;&amp;lsquo;cause&amp;rsquo;): dukkha arises or continues with tanhā (&amp;ldquo;craving, desire or attachment, lit.&amp;ldquo;thirst&amp;rdquo;). tanhā is traditionally interpreted in western languages as the &amp;lsquo;cause&amp;rsquo; of dukkha , tanha can also be seen as the factor tying us to dukkha, or as a response to dukkha, trying to escape it;</description>
