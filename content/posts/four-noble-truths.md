In Buddhism, the Four Noble Truths are "the truths of the Noble Ones", the truths or realities for the "spiritually worthy ones".

The truths are:

dukkha (literally "suffering"; here "unsatisfactoriness") is an innate characteristic of existence in the realm of samsara;

samudaya (origin, arising, combination;'cause'): dukkha arises or continues with tanhā ("craving, desire or attachment, lit."thirst"). tanhā is traditionally interpreted in western languages as the 'cause' of dukkha , tanha can also be seen as the factor tying us to dukkha, or as a response to dukkha, trying to escape it;

nirodha (cessation, ending, confinement): dukkha can be ended or contained by the renouncement or letting go of this tanhā; the confinement of taṇhā releases the excessive bind of dukkha;

marga (path, Noble Eightfold Path) is the path leading to the confinement of tanha and dukkha.
